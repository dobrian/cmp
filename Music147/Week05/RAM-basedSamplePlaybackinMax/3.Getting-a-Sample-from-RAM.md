# Getting a Sample from RAM

The **buffer~** object holds audio data in RAM as an array of 32-bit floating point numbers (floats). The fact that the sound is loaded into RAM, rather than read continuously off the hard drive as the **sfplay~** object does, means that it can be accessed quickly and in various ways, for diverse audio effects (including normal playback).

The most basic way to use a buffer is simply to access each individual sample by incrementing through the array indices at the sample rate. To do that, the best objects to use are **count~**, which puts out a signal that increments by one for each sample, and **index~**, which refers to the **buffer~**'s contents by the sample index received from **count~** and sends that out its outlet. This is good for basic playback with no speed change, or for when you want to access a particular sample within the **buffer~**.

When **count~** receives a *bang*, it begins outputting an incrementing signal, starting from 0 by default. You can cause it to start counting from some other starting sample number by sending a number in its left inlet. (You can also cause it to count in a loop by giving it both a starting and ending number. It will count from the starting number up to one less than the ending number, then will loop back to the starting number.)
