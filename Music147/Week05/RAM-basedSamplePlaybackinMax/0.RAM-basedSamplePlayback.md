# RAM-based Sample Playback in Max

### Summary

Using your computer's random access memory (RAM) to play sound files allows you to access any point in the sound file instantaneously as well as manipulate playback speed and direction easily. This requires preloading a sound file (or recording in realtime) into a buffer, which can then be read from or accessed in a number of ways. This module focuses on using the **buffer~** object to store audio data and access it in a few different approaches to play back samples.
