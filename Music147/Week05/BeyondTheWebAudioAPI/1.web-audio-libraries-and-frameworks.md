# Web Audio Libraries and Frameworks

At this point in the course, take a moment to look again at the [Web Audio
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) page on
the Mozilla Developer Network.  On the left sidebar, you'll see dropdowns for
"Guides" and "Interfaces".  Look at how much you know!  You should feel proud
of how much material you've internalized in these few short weeks.

As we conclude this sequence of lessons on Web Audio API, I want to provide a
suggestion as to where to go next.  The [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
audio framework is built on the Web Audio API, and includes a ton of useful
higher-level abstractions for dealing with audio.  Looking at the
[API](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/) and
[examples](https://tonejs.github.io/examples/), you may even wonder why we
bothered spending all of this time mucking around with low-level `AudioNodes`
when we could have been using these powerful tools!  Of course, the idea is to
give you a strong foundation in the principles of web audio before having you
move on to pure application programming.  However, for your final project,
you're welcome to use the tone.js library (or even one of it's competitors,
like [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) or
[Gibber](http://charlie-roberts.com/gibber/about-gibber/)) either instead of or
in conjunction with Web Audio API.
