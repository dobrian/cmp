# JavaScript and Max: Example Applications

### Application 1: MIDI Harmonizer

Prof. Dobrian has written a MIDI Harmonizer using JavaScript and Max, which can
be found on the [Max Cookbook site](http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/harmonizer-written-javascript).


### Application 2: Transient Detector

JavaScript can also be used to access and manipulate samples stored in a
buffer.  The following code scans through a buffer looking for the largest
difference in amplitude across approximately 50ms of sound; this location is
most likely the location of a transient, i.e. a fast attack.  This code can be
used to automatically crop sounds that begin with silence.
