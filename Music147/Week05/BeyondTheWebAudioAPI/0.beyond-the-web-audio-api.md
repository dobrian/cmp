# Beyond the Web Audio API

This module will discuss ways to use JavaScript to handle audio... without
using the Web Audio API.  The first item touches on web audio libraries and
frameworks, which provide a number of useful higher-level abstractions that are
built on top of the Web Audio API.  The rest of the items provide a tutorial in
how to use JavaScript within Max, allowing you to integrate the two primary
languages taught in this course.  

### Items

1. Web Audio Libraries and Frameworks
2. JavaScript and Max: An Introduction
2. JavaScript and Max: Messages and Lists
2. JavaScript and Max: Building a Transient Detector
