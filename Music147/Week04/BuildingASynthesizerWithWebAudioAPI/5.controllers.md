### Controllers

Once we've built our synthesizer, we need a way to control it.  In Max, you may
use the **ctlin** or **midiin** objects to use an external device like a MIDI
keyboard or drum pad.  There actually exists a way to do this in JavaScript, by
using the Web MIDI API.  Unfortunately, at the time of this recording in
September 2018, the Web MIDI API is not widely implemented among browsers, only
usable in Google Chrome.

Instead of MIDI, let's use the computer keyboard to control notes.  You can use
the events `"keyup"` and `"keydown"` to track the keyboard movements.  Here's how
to track these motions with jQuery.

	$(document).keyup((event) => {
	  let asciiValue = e.which;
	});

Let's play a middle C whenever the "a" key is pressed.  The ASCII value of "a" is 97.

	const audioCtx = new AudioContext();

	const playMiddleC = () => {
	  const oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
	  oscillator.connect(audioCtx.destination);
	  oscillator.start();
	  oscillator.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.now + 1);
	};
	
	$(document).keyup((event) => {
	  if (e.which === 97) {
	    playMiddleC();
	  }
	});
