### Envelopes

You can think of an envelope as a function mapping some feature of the sound
over time.  This feature can be anything the Web Audio API implements as an
`AudioParam`: a `GainNode`'s gain, an `OscillatorNode`'s frequency, a
`BiquadFilterNode`'s Q, etc.  To construct an envelope, you can pick and choose
from the methods available in the `AudioParam` interface, for example,
`.linearRampToValueAtTime()`, `exponentialRampToValueAtTime()`, and
`setValueCurveAtTime()`.

Let's try and construct a traditional ADSR envelope to control the volume of an
oscillator.  For this, let's make two functions: one to represent the onset of
the note, one to represent the release.

	const audioCtx = new AudioContext();

	const oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
	oscillator.frequency.value = 220;
	oscillator.type = "sawtooth";
	oscillatorGain = audioCtx.createGain();
	oscillatorGain.gain.value = 0; // important to start from silence!
	oscillator.connect(oscillatorGain);
	oscillatorGain.connect(audioCtx.destination);
	
	oscillator.start();

	const attack = (attackTime, delayTime, sustainValue) => {
	  gain.setValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.currentTime);
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, audioCtx.currentTime + attackTime);
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(sustainValue, audioCtx.now + attackTime + delayTime);
	};

	const release = (releaseTime) => {
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.currentTime + releaseTime);
	};

### Self-Study

1. Play around with
   [`.setValueCurveAtTime()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam/setValueCurveAtTime)
   as a means of creating self-contained envelopes (i.e. ones that do not
   require separate attack and release triggers).  What is a use case where you
   *would* like separate attack and release triggers?  What is a use case when
   you *wouldn't* like separate attack and release triggers?
2. While it is most intuitive to apply envelopes to gain, you can of course
   apply envelopes to *anything*.  Try appling the ADSR curve from the above
   example to an oscillator's detune.


### Self-Quiz

1. I have an ADSR curve with an attack value of 1, a delay value of 2, a
   sustain value of 0.5, and a release value of 0.5.  If I apply it to an
   oscillator, how long is the resulting sound?

ANSWER: Trick question!  While attack, delay, and release values measure
*time*, the sustain value in fact measures *gain level*.  After the initial
attack and delay (which, in this case, take 3 seconds), the note will last as
long as you want until you trigger the release (which, in this case, is 0.5
seconds).

2. Let's say I have the following float array:

	const curve = new Float32Array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]);

If I call...

	gain.gain.setValueAtTime(curve, audioCtx.currentTime, 10);

...how many seconds will I be hearing sound?

ANSWER: 8 seconds
