### Envelopes

You can think of an envelope as a function mapping some feature of the sound
over time.  This feature can be anything the Web Audio API implements as an
`AudioParam`: a `GainNode`'s gain, an `OscillatorNode`'s frequency, a
`BiquadFilterNode`'s Q, etc.  To construct an envelope, you can pick and choose
from the methods available in the `AudioParam` interface, for example,
`.linearRampToValueAtTime()`, `exponentialRampToValueAtTime()`, and
`setValueCurveAtTime()`.

Let's try and construct a traditional ADSR envelope to control the volume of an
oscillator.  For this, let's make two functions: one to represent the onset of
the note, one to represent the release.

	let oscillator = new OscillatorNode();
	let gain = new GainNode();
	oscillator.connect(gain);
	gain.connect(audioCtx.destination);

	let attack = (attackTime, delayTime, sustainValue) => {
	  gain.setValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.now);
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, audioCtx.now + attackTime);
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(sustainValue, audioCtx.now + attackTime + delayTime);
	};

	let release = (releaseTime) => {
	  gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.now + releaseTime);
	};
