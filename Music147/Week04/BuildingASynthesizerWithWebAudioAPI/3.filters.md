### Filters

To create a filter, instantiate an instance of `BiquadFilterNode()`.  In the
signal chain, hook up an `OscillatorNode()` to the filter, then the filter to
the dac.  It is important you pick a frequency-rich waveform like `"sawtooth"`
or `"square"`, because it will be difficult or impossible to hear the filter's
effects on a frequency-poor waveform like `"triangle"` or `"sine"`.

	const audioCtx = new AudioContext();

	const oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
	oscillator.frequency = 220;
	oscillator.type = "sawtooth";

	const filter = audioCtx.createBiquadFilter();

	oscillator.connect(filter);
	filter.connect(audioCtx.destination);

Filters have a number of properties you may set.  The `.type` property may be
set to basic filter types like `"lowpass"`, `"highpass"`, and `"bandpass"`, as
well as more advanced types like `"peaking"` and `"notch"`.  The `.frequency`
and `.detune` properties may be used to set the cutoff frequency.  In
conjunction with the `.Q` property, you may fine-tune your filter.

	filter.type = "lowpass";
	filter.frequency = 110;
	filter.Q = 5;

You may also hook up an LFO to the filter properties.  You may change all of
the properties that are `AudioParam`s: `.frequency`, `.detune`, and `.Q`.

	const modulator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
	modulator.connect(filter.frequency);
