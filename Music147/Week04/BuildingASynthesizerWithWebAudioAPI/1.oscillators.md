### Oscillators

To create an oscillator, instantiate an `OscillatorNode`.  Once assigned to a
variable, you may adjust its pitch with the `.frequency` and `.detune`
properties: `.frequency` is a number in Hz; `.detune` is a number in cents.  In
addition, you may change the shape of the waveform by assigning the `.type`
property:  The default value is `"sine"`, but you may change that to
`"square"`, `"sawtooth"`, or `"triangle"`.  In order to hear the
oscillator, we must call its `.start()` method, and then finally hook it up to
the dac.

	const audioCtx = new AudioContext();
	const oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
	oscillator.frequency = 220;
	oscillator.detune = 50;
	oscillator.type = "sawtooth";
	oscillator.start();
	oscillator.connect(audioCtx.destination);


### Vocabulary

- `.frequency` vs. `.detune`
- [`OscillatorNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode)
- sawtooth, sine, square, and triangle waves


### Self-Study

1. Recall the formula for converting a MIDI number to a frequency.  Write a
   function that takes in a MIDI number and plays the corresponding frequency.
2. Familiarize yourself with the sounds of the four basic waveforms: sawtooth,
   sine, square, and triangle.  Try combining different oscillators that have
   different waveforms.  What combinations are effective?  What combinations
   are ineffective?  You may also find it interesting to play around with
   different osciallators at frequencies which correspond to the overtone
   series of some fundamental.
