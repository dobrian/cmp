### Oscillators

To create an oscillator, instantiate an `OscillatorNode`.  Once assigned to a
variable, you may adjust its pitch with the `.frequency` and `.detune`
properties: `.frequency` is a number in Hz; `.detune` is a number in cents.  In
addition, you may change the shape of the waveform by assigning the `.type`
property:  The default value is `"sine"`, but you may change that to
`"square"`, `"sawtooth"`, `"triangle"`, or `"custom"`.  In order to hear the
oscillator, we must call its `.start()` method, and then finally hook it up to
the dac.

	let oscillator = new OscillatorNode();
	oscillator.frequency = 220;
	oscillator.detune = 50;
	oscillator.type = "sawtooth";
	oscillator.start();
	oscillator.connect(audioCtx.destination);
