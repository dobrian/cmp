Examples of User Interfaces in Max
==================================


Open the Max patch named "BasicUI"

There are pre-made graphical user interface (GUI) objects in Max that are useful for representing and controlling different kinds of data within your patch. These objects typically represent some physical analog device such as a button, knob, slider, or keyboard (see the first tutorial in this module) and can be helpful in creating an intuitive interactive experience with your code.

If we look at the "BasicUI" patch, we see a relatively simple and common set of GUIs used in musical applications. Where appropriate, the GUIs are accompanied by simple text to explain their function. In some cases, like with the keyboard or musical note staff, these do not need additional explanation, as they are familiar enough within a musical context for their function to be readily identifiable.

It is easy enough to interact with this patch without any additional instruction, other than reading the basic functional descriptions of each GUI. Try interacting with the patch and see if you can give a more thorough and in-depth explanation for what each of the 7 GUI objects do within the patch.

Note that we are viewing this patch in Presentation Mode, which will only show us certain specifically chosen aspects of the code. If we click the Patching Mode button on the bottom of your toolbar, you'll see the underlying code in its entirety. Here we can see there are a few more objects and patch cables connecting everything together. Not all of this code is useful for a "user" to see or interact with, therefore we choose certain aspects that are relevant and useful for the user's interactive experience.

Open the Max patch named "BasicUI2"

This patch contains a few examples of useful MSP GUIs for controlling audio, specifically volume and amplitude. (Remember to turn on your DAC in the lower righthand corner to start MSP audio!) The first section of code in the top left corner shows perhaps the easiest way to control the amplitude of a sound. Clicking and dragging on the *float box* will increase and decrease the output amplitude of the *noise~* object. Remember however, we do not hear amplitude linearly, so representing how loud something is as a number such as "0.257" may not give us useful or intuitive information. Additionally, doubling a sound's amplitude will generally not make it twice as loud, so interacting with the object may be difficult in a performance context for example. The other sections of code show various GUIs that are useful in both visually representing and controlling a sound's volume in a musical or performative context. Adjust the sliders on the *gain~* and *live.gain~* objects. Notice how dB is a more intuitive representation of how loud the output is in relation to how we actually hear it. The *gain~* object is useful when interfacing with MIDI controllers, as it conveniently works with 0 (silence) to 127 (0dB) values. On the other hand, the *live.gain~* object has the slider and visual meter built-in to one. How you represent your code and decide what is useful or relevant data is ultimately up to you.
