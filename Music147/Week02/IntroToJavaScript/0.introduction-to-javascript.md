# Introduction to JavaScript

## Summary

The "Introduction to JavaScript" module consists of seven items.  The goal is
to help you teach yourself JavaScript.  The first two modules provide
background and resources for learning JavaScript.  The next four modules will
summarize the similarities and differences JavaScript has with other languages;
you should use these as a *supplement* to your other research, not as a
*replaement* for it.  The final module will be a big self-test.  This will help
you gauge how well you are learning the language, and whether your are ready to
move onto the next modules.
