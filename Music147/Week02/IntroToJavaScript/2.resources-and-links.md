# Resources and Links

Since JavaScript is one of the [most popular languages in the
world](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages),
we are not going to provide our own intro-to-JavaScript tutorial, as to avoid
[NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#In_computing).
Instead, we expect you to learn the language on your own, from various
tutorials and/or books linked here.  While this may seem like a tall order,
you'll find that learning your second programming language will be much easier
than learning your first, not to mention that the ability to quickly learn and
translate between languages will be essential when working in the real world!

To provide you with some guidance and to keep you on track, we have created a
set of [questions for understanding](todo) at the end of this module: if you
feel comfortable answering each of those questions, you are ready to move on to
the more advanced parts of this course.

Finally, this module contains a [short primer](todo) describing JavaScript
syntax, as well as a number of videos summarizing the differences between
JavaScript and other languages you may know.  ([Here](todo), [here](todo),
[here](todo), and [here](todo).)  You may want to start with the primer and
these videos, and if they seem too confusing or over-your-head, then you might
benefit from spending some time with a few of the resources provided below.


### Resources to Learn JavaScript

- [Best-Of Book List](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/12-books-every-javascript-developer-should-read-9da76157fb3)
- [Best-Of Online Tutorial List](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-javascript)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  - Codecademy has some free resources, some paid; the interactive element is
    what sets it apart from other tutorials.
- The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
  tutorials
  - The MDN documentation should be your go-to when trying to answer
    JavaScript syntax and library questions, and their tutorials are clear
    and comprehensive.
- [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do)
  by Douglas Crockford
  - An oldie-but-goodie, the Crockford summarizes some of the growing pains
    JavaScript has undergone the past several years, while also containing
    some good philosophy when it comes to good programming vs. bad
    programming.


### Resources to Learn HTML

- The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  - Once reviled to the point of [active protest](http://www.w3fools.com/),
    these tutorials have gotten better and more up-to-date; I still wouldn't
    use w3schools for JavaScript, but for something simple like HTML it should
    be mostly harmless.


### Other Resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
  - Absolutely the best programming Q&A site.
- [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
  or [AirBnB's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - Two of many style guides: it's less important which style guide you follow,
    more that you just follow one at all.


### Above and Beyond

The following subjects are not strictly-speaking relevant for this course, but
if you can surmount the additional learning curves, you'll find that your
web-based projects will be far simpler and far more elegant.

- Learning [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) will make communication between
  JavaScript and HTML 1000 times easier.  There are jQuery tutorials on
  Codecademy and on the jQuery site.
- If you are building a large web application, chances are at some point you'll
  be exposed to one of many JavaScript frameworks.  Among the most popualar are
  [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/),
  [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/), and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/);
  each of those sites have their own tutorials.
- Learning CSS is vital if you want to make your web applications actually
  *look* good.  There exist CSS frameworks like
  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and
  [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/), as well as more low-level
  extensions of CSS like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and
  [Less](http://lesscss.org/).  Usually, CSS is taught along with JavaScript
  and HTML as a sort of HTML/CSS/JavaScript-hybrid, but since there is so much
  else to learn in this course, we are making the CSS portion optional.
