# Setting Up a Development Environment

### Components of a Web Application

Throughout this course, you will be making "web applications".  Web
applications consist of three parts:

1. HTML, which creates the elements of a webpage,
2. CSS, which describes how the elements **look**, and
3. JavaScript, which describes how the elements **move**

For the sake of simplicity, we will be using exclusively HTML and JavaScript in
this course, although we encourage you to prettify your assignments and
projects with CSS if you'd like.


### Setting Up a Development Environment

There are [countless
IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#JavaScript)
one can use to write JavaScript.  However, in this course, we encourage you to
use a text editor instead.  Text editors will give you a rawer, more hands-on
understanding of how different elements of a web application interact.  If
you're brand-new to text editors, you might find it easiest to start with
either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/),
although if you're looking to establish some more serious hacker cred, try
looking at [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
[vim](https://www.vim.org/).

[This
article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)
provides a good and thorough introduction to how you should organize the files
of your web application on your computer.  To get started right away, save the
following text into a file called "myapp.html":

	<!doctype html>
	<html lang="en">
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <h1>Hello JavaScript!</h1>
	    <!-- put more HTML tags here! -->
	    <script src="myapp.js"></script>
	  </body>
	</html>

To see this file in action, open up "myapp.html" with your web browser of choice.

Now, create a new file called "myapp.js" in the same folder as "myapp.html".
This file can start with the following:

	let message = "Hello JavaScript!"
	console.log(message);

The `console.log()` function is the JavaScript equivalent of a `print`
statement.  In order to actually *see* the output, though, you need to open the
web console in your browser.  The way to do this differs from browser to
browser:

- Chrome: Tools -> View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console (alt-cmd-J)
- Firefox: Tools -> Web Developer -> Web Console (alt-cmd-K)
- Edge: TODO

If you want to change either "myapp.html" or "myapp.js", you will need to save
the file, and then refresh the web page on your browser.

Play around by changing the message in "myapp.js", or by adding new tags to
"myapp.html"!
