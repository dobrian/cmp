# Introduction to HTML and JavaScript

### Course Expectations and Prerequisites

In this course, you will complete different assignments using different
programming languages.  The two primary languages you will use are Max and
JavaScript.  Max is a graphical programming language specifically designed for
music and audio applications; as such, it is probably quite unlike any language
you have used before.  (See the [Max module](todo) for an introduction to Max.)
JavaScript, on the other hand, is a general-purpose, text-based language with a
diverse array of applications.  Chances are, JavaScript will seem much less
foreign to you than Max will, since it resembles many other languages in common
usage today.

Since this is *not* an intro programming course, we will assume that you are
already familiar with at least one other programming languageâ€”most likely,
something like Python, Java, C++, R, or MATLAB.  We also assume that you are
familiar with elementary programming concepts like variables, functions,
control flow (e.g. "if" statements, "for" loops, and "while" loops), and data
types (e.g. integers, floating point numbers, strings, and arrays).  If
programming is new to you, the assignments in this course may be quite
difficult, and you should expect to put in quite a bit of extra work in these
next couple weeks to catch up with the rest of the class.


### Module Summary

The "Introduction to HTML and JavaScript" module consists of seven items.  The
goal is to help you teach yourself HTML and JavaScript.  The first two modules
provide background and resources for learning HTML and JavaScript.  The next
four modules will summarize the similarities and differences JavaScript has
with other languages; you should use these as a *supplement* to your other
research, not as a *replacement* for it.  The final module will be a big
self-test.  This will help you gauge how well you are learning the language,
and whether your are ready to move onto the next modules.
