### Max vs. Web Audio API

JavaScript's Web Audio API shares a number of characteristics with Max.  In
Max, we create and alter sounds using objects with tildes; in Web Audio API, we
create and alter sounds using
"[`AudioNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode)s".
In Max, we connect objects together using patch cords; with Web Audio API, we
connect `AudioNode`s together using the
[`.connect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode/connect)
method.  Finally, whereas in Max, all objects live in a "patch", with Web Audio
API, all `AudioNode`s exist inside of an
[`AudioContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext).

This is the Max equivalent of a "hello world": playing a sine tone through a
**dac~**.  Here, the sine tone is 300 Hz, and it's being fed through a **\*~**
at half gain.  How would we build the equivalent program with Web Audio API?

The first thing we do is create an `AudioContext`, which is the equivalent of
starting a new patch.  Then we create our three `AudioNode`s: an oscillator, a
gain, and the dac.  Note that `AudioContext` has a built-in dac, which we can
access with `audioCtx.destination`.

	let audioCtx = new AudioContext();
	let osc = new OscillatorNode();
	let gain = new GainNode();
	let dac = audioCtx.destination;

Now, we can customize our `AudioNode`s.  To set an oscillator's frequency, we
set the `osc.frequency.value` property.  To set a gain's gain, we set the
`gain.gain.value` property.  Technically, `osc.frequency` and `gain.gain` are
implementations of the
[`AudioParam`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam)
interface.  This interface contains useful methods like
[`.linearRampToValueAtTime()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam/linearRampToValueAtTime)
and
[`.setValueCurveAtTime()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam/setValueCurveAtTime)
that allow you to smoothly interpolate between a parameter's values.

	osc.frequency.value = 300;
	let gain.gain.value = 0.5

Finally, we connect the `AudioNode`s together, just like we would connect
objects with patch cords.  The last line of code tells the oscillator to start
producing sound.

	osc.connect(gain);
	gain.connect(dac);
	osc.start();

One significant difference between Max and Web Audio API is that in Max, the
objects always remain in the patch, whether or not the dac is on or if they're
producing sound.  In Web Audio API, on the other hand, once an `AudioNode`
*stops* producing sound, it goes away forever.  As a result, to create multiple
simultaneous or successive sounds, you may have to create an `AudioNode` for
each one.  Don't feel weird if you're writing a programming that creates
hundreds or even thousands of `AudioNode`s: as long as you remember to stop
each one (which triggers the garbage collector), your program will run just
fine.
