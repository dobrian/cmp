# User Input in HTML and JavaScript: A Quick Reference

### Buttons

Perhaps the most straightforward way to interact with your application is to
create a button.  Buttons use the `<button></button>` HTML tag.  Make sure to
give each button a unique ID so that you can easily reference it with jQuery.

	<!-- in your HTML -->
	<button id="my-button">Click me!</button>

	// in your JavaScript
	$("#my-button").on("click", () => {
	  // do some stuff
	});


### Form Elements

Form elements are excellent for allowing users to supply custom settings for
their application.  Many of these elements are variations on the `<input />`
tag.  Some examples are as follows:

	<!-- an ordinary text box -->
	<input id="my-input" type="text" />

	<!-- a number box -->
	<input id="my-input" type="number" />

	<!-- a slider -->
	<input id="my-input" type="range" />

	<!-- a toggle -->
	<input id="my-toggle" type="checkbox" />

	<!-- a dropdown menu -->
	<select id="my-input">
	  <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
	  <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
	  <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
	</select>

Generally speaking, you can get the value of most input elements as follows:

	$("#my-input").val();

However, checkboxes require a different construction:

	$("#my-input").is(":checked");

For more on inputs—as well as how to set useful attributes like minimum and
maximum values, step sizes, and default values—look at the [MDN page for the
input
element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input).
Also, if you'd like to make your inputs more user-friendly, you can pretty them
up with the
[`<label></label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)
and/or
[`<fieldset></fieldset>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset)
tags.

### Mouse and Keyboard

You can get the state of the mouse using jQuery, as follows:

	$(document).on("click", () => {
	  // do something when you click the mouse
	});

	$(document).on("mousemove", (event) => {
	  // get x and y coordinates of mouse
	  let xValue = event.pageX;
	  let yValue = event.pageY;
	});

You can also get the state of the keyboard using jQuery, as follows:

	$(document).on("keydown", (event) => {
	  // get ASCII value of the key that's pressed
	  // (check out asciitable.com)
	  let asciiValue = event.which;
	});
