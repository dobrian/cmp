# Sample Recording and Playback with Web Audio API

This module will show you how to use Web Audio API to interact with audio files
via a web page.  The first lesson illustrates a number of different ways you
can load and play a sound file.  The second lesson walks you through a more
sophisticated process of building a granulator application.  The third lesson
shows you how to use an microphone—like the one in your laptop—in order to
record audio and have it interact with a larger web application.
