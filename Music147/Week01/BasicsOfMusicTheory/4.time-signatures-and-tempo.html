        <h3>Time Signatures</h3>

        <p>So far, we have only looked at measures in 4/4, meaning each measure has four
        quarter notes.  We can also have measures in 3/4, meaning each measure has
        three quarter notes.  Each of these ratios is known as a "time signature", or
        "meter".  It is possible to have any positive integer in the numerator of a
        time signature: so 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, and so on, are all valid time
        signatures.  However, in the denominator of a time signature, you may have only
        a power of two: so 2/2, 5/8, and 17/16 are valid time signatures, but 4/3, 2/7,
        and 8/5 are not.</p>

        <h3>Tempo</h3>

        <p>One remaining aspect of rhythm is speed.  Sometimes your beat is fast; other
        times it's slow.  The speed of the beat is known as "tempo".  Most musicians
        are used to representing tempo as beats per minute, or BPM.  This means that if
        your beat is a quarter note—as in 4/4 or 3/4—a tempo of 60 BPM means there are
        60 quarter notes per minute, or one quarter note every second.  If your beat is
        an eighth note, as in 6/8 or 12/8, a tempo of 60 BPM means there are 60
        <em>eighth</em> notes per minute, which means there are 30 quarter notes per minute,
        or one quarter note every two seconds.  Musicians often omit the letters "BPM"
        when discussing tempo, instead saying things like "quarter note equals 90" or
        "eighth note equals one-hundred thirty-two".</p>
