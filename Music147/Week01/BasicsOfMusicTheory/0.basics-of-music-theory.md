# Basics of Music Theory

## Summary

The "Basics of Music Theory" module consists of six items.  The first four are
optional, since they will be mostly review for students who have previously
taken music classes or private lessons.  The last two items are mandatory, as
they explain how to represent basic music theoretical concepts within the
computer.
