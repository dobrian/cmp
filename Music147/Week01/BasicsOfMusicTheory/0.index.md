Summary
=======

The "Basics of Music Theory Module" consists of five items.  The first three
are optional, since they will be mostly review for students who have previously
taken music classes or private lessons.  The last two items are mandatory, as
they explain how to represent basic music theoretical concepts within the
computer.
