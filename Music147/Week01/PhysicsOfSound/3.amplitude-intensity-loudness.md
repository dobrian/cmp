Amplitude, Intensity, and Loudness
==================================

Sound is variation in air pressure detectable by the human ear. It is a wave characterized by the transmission of energy in the form of compression (increased pressure) and rarefaction (decreased pressure) through a medium. Sound travels as a longitudinal wave, in which particles move back and forth along the line of the traveling wave. *Amplitude* is a wave's maximum variation in air pressure (from normal atmospheric pressure).

The amplitude of a wave is related to the amount of energy it carries. A wave with high amplitude carries more energy than a wave with low amplitude. The average amount of energy passing through a unit area per unit of time in a specified direction is called *intensity*.

The amount of energy per unit time is power, and intensity is therefore the amount of power transmitted through a unit area in a specified direction. Power is measured in watts, and intensity is therefore measured in watts per square meter. Scientists often specify sound intensity as a ratio, however. The sound intensity level, I, in decibels is defined as 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of a sound wave to a reference intensity.



Amplitude is related to loudness: increasing a sound's amplitude will make it sound louder and vice versa. Loudness is however a subjective perception of sound pressure, not an absolute measurement. When we talk about loudness, we are usually talking about our perception of its relative sound pressure level (SPL) measured in the relative units of decibels (dB).

Moreover, it would be incorrect to say that a sound with a higher amplitude is necessarily louder than a sound with a lower amplitude.
