<h1 id="harmonic-overtone-series">Harmonic/Overtone Series</h1>
<p>When describing frequency we used a simple waveform––a sine
wave––to describe the basic principle of oscillation or vibration. A 'simple waveform'
(i.e. sine wave) is made up of a single frequency: a perfect oscillation resulting in a
periodically repeating waveform (i.e. its “cycle”). In reality, no acoustic
instrument creates a simple waveform when it makes sound (though tuning forks can be
quite close). Instead, acoustic instruments create 'complex waveforms':
the addition or presence of many simple waveforms.
Virtually all acoustic instruments use some kind of force
or energy (usually friction) to generate vibrations (i.e. sound)
on a physical object (like a string or tube) called a resonator.
This force or energy comes with some kind of instability and the resonator it
acts upon vibrates at many modes simultaneously, forming
a complex reaction to the input force (rather than a mathematically pure and
stable reaction like a sine tone). These simultaneous vibrational modes result in what
are called 'overtones', 'partials', or 'harmonics' (also referred to as spectra or
spectrum).</p>
<p>The 'harmonic/overtone series' is a relationship of whole number integers
starting from a fundamental frequency. The 'fundamental frequency' is the lowest
partial present in a complex waveform. A 'partial' is any single frequency of a
complex waveform. A 'harmonic' is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency,
while an 'overtone' refers to any partial (harmonic or inharmonic) above the
fundamental frequency.</p>

<p>If we examine the sonic activation of a violin’s A string (A440) for example,
there is more than just one single frequency present,
but rather a multitude of frequencies that have rational integer
relationships above a fundamental frequency.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency</a></p>
<p>The string in this case will produce (vibrate) other frequencies in
integer relationships above the fundamental frequency. So, the open A-string of a
violin will produce the fundamental frequency 440 Hz with overtones at [2 x 440],
[3 x 440], [4 x 440], [5 x 440], etc. These overtones each decrease in
amplitude (i.e. perceptibility/volume) as they increase in harmonicity (or the number
of integer overtones). We hear 440 Hz as the fundamental pitch, because
it is the lowest perceivable partial.</p>

<p>The fundamental frequency is typically the pitch we ‘hear’
(as a perceived psychoacoustic phenomenon), regardless of the amplitude and distribution of
a tone's overtone structure. This fundamental frequency is generally what we
refer to as the ‘pitch’ of a certain ‘note’. All the overtones
are perceived as ‘color’ or ‘timbral’ changes to the fundamental frequency. Our
brains fuse these partials together so that we hear all these related constituent
frequencies as a single tone.</p>
<p>The presence (i.e. amplitude) and distribution of overtones or partials is
generally referred to as timbre in music (pronounced “tamber”). Timbre is
how we can tell the difference between a violin, trumpet, or voice singing
the exact same pitch. If each of those instruments were to
produce an A440 (i.e. the same fundamental frequency), we could still tell the
difference between each tone because of their harmonic spectra or overtone structure
(these terms are relatively interchangeable and synonymous for the most part).</p>
<p>Most acoustic instruments have a rather predictable overtone structure
(resonators like strings or air for example). But objects like bells or other
percussive instruments have a more complex overtone structure,
making it more difficult to hear or perceive its fundamental pitch. Sounds with overtone structures
that do not have rational integer relationships are referred to as inharmonic.
These types of sounds tend to be more 'noisey'.
We don't tend to hear a specific pitch coming from a snare drum or cymbal
for example because they have a dense, inharmonic set of partials.</p>
