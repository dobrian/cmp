        <hr width="50%"/>
        <p> This website of educational materials on the topic of <b>Computer Music Programming</b> is made possible by a grant from the <a href="">Innovative Learning Technology Initiative (ILTI)</a> of the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/index.html">University of California Office of the President (UCOP)</a>. The materials were created in support of the UC Irvine hybrid course on <b>Computer Audio and Music Programming</b>, Music 147 Studies in Music Technology, cross-listed as Informatics 190 and Computer Science 190, taught by Dr. <a href="https://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/">Christopher Dobrian</a>, Professor of Music with a joint appointment in Informatics at UC Irvine. </p>
        <p> The materials in this website were prepared under the direction of Christopher Dobrian, with contributions by  himself, Mark Micchelli, Alex Lough, Omar Costa Hamido, and Kevin Anthony. All educational materials here are owned by the University of California, and are made publicly available for use by educators and programmers, with the expectation that proper attribution and credit will be included anywhere these material are used. </p>
        <p> The <b>Topics</b> cover a wide range of subjects that are necessary and useful for anyone intending to program applications that deal with sound and music. Each Topic consists of one or more <b>Lessons</b>, small instruction modules intended to teach one element of the topic in question. Working <b>Examples</b> are provided&mdash;both in <a href="https://cycling74.com/">Max</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">WebAudio API</a>&mdash;that demonstrate solutions to common programming tasks. A much larger collection of Max examples is available in the online <a href="https://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/"><b>Max Cookbook</b></a> by Christopher Dobrian. </p>
        <p> The <b>Week-by-Week Plan</b> reflects an organization of Topics and Lessons that was used in the Music 147 course as it was taught in spring 2020. The <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/24521">Music 147 class website</a> is based in the Canvas learning management system at UC Irvine, where relevant Assignments and further Resources are posted. However, the Lessons in this site are presented as self-contained modules that an instructor may organize in any configuration appropriate for a similar or related course of instruction. It's hoped that the Lessons in this site will prove valuable to instructors, students, and self-educating programmers alike. <b>Additional Resources</b> for further study are also provided. </p>
        <p> This website will continue to grow and evolve as more Topics, Lessons, Examples, and Additional Resources are added with each iteration of the course. </p>
