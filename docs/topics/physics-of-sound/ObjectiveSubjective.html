<h1>
Objective / Subjective
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
In everyday conversation, we use the adjective <i>objective</i> to mean unbiased, based on fact, as opposed to a biased <i>subjective</i> viewpoint or opinion. In experimental psychology, those terms are used to make a distinction between a phenomenon that is objectively measurable by an instrument and a person's subjective perception as they report experiencing it. For example, a sound's intensity (power per unit area) is measurable, whereas its <u>loudness</u> can only be reported by a human <u>subject</u> as a response to their perception. This distinction is sometimes important when discussing objective measurements of sounds&mdash;frequency, amplitude, time interval between onsets&mdash;and relating them to our subjective impressions of pitch, loudness, and musical tempo.
</p>
<p>
The <i>just noticeable difference</i> (JND) is a term used in psychology/physiology, and is defined as the amount of increase or decrease in a stimulus (pitch, loudness, etc.) required for the average person to detect a change. This has been shown empirically to be best expressed as a ratio (a multiplication factor) of the magnitude of the phenomenon, rather than as an arithmetic difference (an addition or subtraction).
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeberÐFechner_law"> Weber-Fechner law</a> is actually a pair of related principles, one by Ernst Weber and the other by Gustav Fechner, two 19th-century scientists. Weber was the originator of the concept of JND, and his law posits that <b>the ratio of JND remains essentially constant regardless of the magnitude of the phenomenon being measured</b>. For example, if the smallest change I can just barely notice in a 20-lb. weight is 1 lb., the JND factor is 1/20=0.05, so I could expect that the JND for a 100-lb. weight is 100*0.05=5 lb. Fechner's closely-related law is that <b>the subjective perceptual impression of a phenomenon is proportional to the logarithm of its empirical intensity</b>. For example, a linear increase in the measurable frequency of a tone results in a logarithmic change in one's subjective perception of the sound's musical pitch; conversely, a linear increase in musical pitch&mdash;say, an ascending chromatic scale&mdash;corresponds to an exponential increase in the tone's frequency.
</p>
<p>
An explanation of this phenomenon, with respect to the weight of an object, is presented in a Khan Academy video titled <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/nervous-system-and-sensory-infor/sensory-perception-topic/v/webers-law-and-thresholds">"Weber's law and thresholds"</a>.
</p>
<p>
In computer audio we commonly talk about linearly measured amplitude of a sound wave, between 1 (full amplitude) and 0 (silence) in terms of the unit called the <i>decibel</i>, which is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of two amplitudes. In computer music, we talk about the linearly measured frequency of a wave in terms of its musical pitch (MIDI number), which is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of two frequencies.
