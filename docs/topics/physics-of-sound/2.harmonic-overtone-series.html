<h1>Harmonic/Overtone Series</h1>

<p>When describing frequency we used a simple waveform––a sine
wave––to describe the basic principle of oscillation or vibration. A 'simple waveform'
(i.e. sine wave) is made up of a single frequency: a perfect oscillation resulting in a
periodically repeating waveform (i.e. its “cycle”). In reality, no acoustic
instrument creates a simple waveform when it makes sound (though tuning forks can be
quite close). Instead, acoustic instruments create 'complex waveforms':
the addition or presence of many simple waveforms.
Virtually all acoustic instruments use some kind of force
or energy (usually friction) to generate vibrations (i.e. sound)
on a physical object (like a string or tube) called a resonator.
This force or energy comes with some kind of instability and the resonator it
acts upon vibrates at many modes simultaneously, forming
a complex reaction to the input force (rather than a mathematically pure and
stable reaction like a sine tone). These simultaneous vibrational modes result in what
are called 'overtones', 'partials', or 'harmonics' (also referred to as spectra or
spectrum).</p>

<p>The 'harmonic/overtone series' is a relationship of whole number integers
starting from a fundamental frequency. The 'fundamental frequency' is the lowest
partial present in a complex waveform. A 'partial' is any single frequency of a
complex waveform. A 'harmonic' is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency,
while an 'overtone' refers to any partial (harmonic or inharmonic) above the
fundamental frequency.</p>

<p>If we examine the sonic activation of a violin’s A string (A440) for example,
there is more than just one single frequency present,
but rather a multitude of frequencies that have rational integer
relationships above a fundamental frequency.</p>

<img src="2.overtones.png">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency</a></p>

<p>The string in this case will produce (vibrate) other frequencies in
integer relationships above the fundamental frequency. So, the open A-string of a
violin will produce the fundamental frequency 440 Hz with overtones at [2 x 440],
[3 x 440], [4 x 440], [5 x 440], etc. These overtones each decrease in
amplitude (i.e. perceptibility/volume) as they increase in harmonicity (or the number
of integer overtones). We hear 440 Hz as the fundamental pitch, because
it is the lowest perceivable partial.</p>

<p>The fundamental frequency is typically the pitch we ‘hear’
(as a perceived psychoacoustic phenomenon), regardless of the amplitude and distribution of
a tone's overtone structure. This fundamental frequency is generally what we
refer to as the ‘pitch’ of a certain ‘note’. All the overtones
are perceived as ‘color’ or ‘timbral’ changes to the fundamental frequency. Our
brains fuse these partials together so that we hear all these related constituent
frequencies as a single tone.</p>

<p>The presence (i.e. amplitude) and distribution of overtones or partials is
generally referred to as timbre in music (pronounced “tamber”). Timbre is
how we can tell the difference between a violin, trumpet, or voice singing
the exact same pitch. If each of those instruments were to
produce an A440 (i.e. the same fundamental frequency), we could still tell the
difference between each tone because of their harmonic spectra or overtone structure
(these terms are relatively interchangeable and synonymous for the most part).</p>

<p>Most acoustic instruments have a rather predictable overtone structure
(resonators like strings or air for example). But objects like bells or other
percussive instruments have a more complex overtone structure,
making it more difficult to hear or perceive its fundamental pitch. Sounds with overtone structures
that do not have rational integer relationships are referred to as inharmonic.
These types of sounds tend to be more 'noisey'.
We don't tend to hear a specific pitch coming from a snare drum or cymbal
for example because they have a dense, inharmonic set of partials.</p>

        <h3>scope~ and spectroscope~ in Max</h3>

        <p>
          This is a short introduction to visualizing signals in Max. When we want to produce a sine wave, we create a cycle~ object. In order to listen to this pure tone, we need to connect it to the speaker outputs and enable the DSP processing. We can create an ezdac~ object for this effect and, just as a precaution, we will also create a gain~ object to control the signal level coming out of our speakers. In terms of visual feedback, in Max we have a couple objects that can help us better understand the signal that we are producing. The meter~ object, as the name indicates, is a simple object that signals the level of the incoming signal, this can be useful for example to quickly figure out if one or the other object is sending a weak or strong signal, or no signal at all. In a similar fashion, the number~ object tells the exact amplitude value of the samples coming in. But then, we have the scope~ object which gives us a more detailed visual feedback of the incoming signal. With this object we can clearly see the waveform of the incoming signal and how it compresses when we raise the frequency. There are different ways to adjust this window's resolution, but for the time being let's just set it in automatic mode. If we create an additional cycle~ object, with a different frequency, and add it to our original signal, we can see that it makes the waveform look slightly more complex. And if we add more cycle~ objects, it will get even more complex. Another object worth looking at, when trying to understand our signals is the spectroscope~. This object, instead of showing amplitude over time, will show us amplitude over frequency. In our current example we can see that there are three peaks corresponding to the three sine waves that we added together - it's the waveform complexity put into perspective, if you will. Waveforms other than the sine (or cosine) wave, will have different complexities. The rect~ object creates a square wave that, as you can see, it's a rather complex waveform. In turn, the saw~ object creates a sawtooth looking waveform, as you can confirm by the scope~ object, and it is also a complex waveform with different rules for its partials.

        <h3>3 ways to get your own Local Web Server</h3>

        <p>
          This is a video on 3 ways to get a Local Web Server running. Method 1: using Nodejs. Navigate to nodejs.org and install Nodejs. Once you have Nodejs installed, navigate to npmjs.com and search for "local web server". Open the package page and scroll down to copy the install command. Open a terminal window and paste the install code and run it. Once you have both Nodejs and Local Web Server installed, navigate to the folder for which you want to serve its files. Type "ws" and press enter. You web server is running on port 8000. On a browser, navigate to localhost:8000. These are the files that you are serving. Open an html page, and confirm that it is working. Go back to the terminal window, and press control-C to end your server. Method 2: using Python. If you have Python 2.7 installed on your machine, you can navigate to the folder that you want to host and type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer. Then press enter and your server will be running on port 8000. On a browser, navigate to localhost:8000. Open a file, and confirm that it is working. Go back to the terminal window and push control-C to end your server. Method 3: using google chrome. Open Google and search for: google chrome web server. Open the link for the chrome web store and install Web Server for Chrome. After installing Web Server for Chrome, open a new tab and navigate to apps to open the Web Server. On the window that opens, you might want to click "Choose Folder" to select the folder that you want to host. Copy the web server URL, and paste it in the browser. Open a file, and confirm that it is working. Go back to the Web Server for Chrome window to disable the webserver.
