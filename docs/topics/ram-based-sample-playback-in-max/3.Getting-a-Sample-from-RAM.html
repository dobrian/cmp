<h1>Getting a Sample from RAM</h1>

<p>The <strong>buffer~</strong> object holds audio data in RAM as an array of 32-bit floating point numbers (floats). The fact that the sound is loaded into RAM, rather than read continuously off the hard drive as the <strong>sfplay~</strong> object does, means that it can be accessed quickly and in various ways, for diverse audio effects (including normal playback).</p>

<p>The most basic way to use a buffer is simply to access each individual sample by incrementing through the array indices at the sample rate. To do that, the best objects to use are <strong>count~</strong>, which puts out a signal that increments by one for each sample, and <strong>index~</strong>, which refers to the <strong>buffer~</strong>'s contents by the sample index received from <strong>count~</strong> and sends that out its outlet. This is good for basic playback with no speed change, or for when you want to access a particular sample within the <strong>buffer~</strong>.</p>

<p>When <strong>count~</strong> receives a <em>bang</em>, it begins outputting an incrementing signal, starting from 0 by default. You can cause it to start counting from some other starting sample number by sending a number in its left inlet. (You can also cause it to count in a loop by giving it both a starting and ending number. It will count from the starting number up to one less than the ending number, then will loop back to the starting number.)</p>
