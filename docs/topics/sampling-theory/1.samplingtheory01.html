<h1 id="discrete-samples-of-a-continuous-signal">Discrete Samples of a Continuous Signal</h1>

<p>You&#39;re probably aware that when you&#39;re watching a movie you&#39;re actually watching a series of still photographs. Conventionally, 24 snapshots&mdash;also known as frames&mdash;are captured per second, and those are later played back (displayed one after the other) at a constant rate of 24 frames per second, the same rate at which the snapshots were taken. That means that the photos are shot at a rate of one every 1/24 of a second&mdash;which is to say every 0.041667 seconds, or every 41.667 milliseconds.</p>

<p>We think of the real world as being continuous. We think of time as a continuous flow, within which the objects in the world move (or don&#39;t) and change (or don&#39;t). We, and the rest of the world, move constantly forward in time. We can recall the past only with our memory, or with some sort of capture-and-storage mechanism such as a camera. With a camera we can, in effect, freeze time, by capturing and storing one instant as a still image. With a movie camera, we take 24 snapshots per second, and we can then replay the past by showing those photos at the same rate. Thus, with a series of discrete images, we can simulate the continuous flow of time.</p>

<p>Digital recording of sound works in much the same way, although we need to take many more than 24 snapshots of the sound per second. We use a microphone to transduce sound energy into an electrical signal. The voltage of that signal changes analogously to (proportionally to) the changing air pressure of the sound wave. At regular intervals, a computer can measure that voltage and represent it as a number, and store that number in memory. For accurate representation of sound, we need to take many thousands of measurements per second. For example, a CD recording uses a rate of 44,100 samples per second. Later we can read through those numbers at the same rate, and convert them back to voltages to drive a loudspeaker.</p>

<p>For this audio capture process, a circuit called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_and_hold">sample-and-hold</a> is used.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="./sample-and-hold.svg" alt="Sample-and-hold Signal"><br>
<em>The gray curve represents the continuously changing voltage of the input signal. The red indicates the discrete voltages that are sampled periodically and held constant until the next sample.</em></p>

<p>The sample-and-hold circuit periodically holds its input voltage constant, giving the computer time to measure the voltage and quantize it as a numerical value.</p>

<p>The result is an ordered file of numbers&mdash;in this case, 44,100 numbers per second of sound. Just as a movie shows us 24 still images per second, a digital recording reproduces 44,100 constant voltages per second. A filter circuit is used to smooth that signal, so that it effectively replicates the continuously changing voltage of the original sound signal.</p>
