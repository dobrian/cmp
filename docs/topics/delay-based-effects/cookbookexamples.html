<h2>Max Cookbook Examples</h2>

<p>
Many audio effects require use of a time-delayed copy of a sound: for creating an echo effect, for simulating room reverberation, for filtering (changing the frequency content of a sound), and for a variety of other delay-based effects such as flanging, chorusing, Doppler shift, etc. Here are some examples in the <a href="http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/">Max Cookbook</a> that demonstrate various delay-based effects.
