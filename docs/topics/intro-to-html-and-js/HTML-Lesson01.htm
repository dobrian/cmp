<!-- An HTML document contains different sorts of "elements", which are indicated by HTML "tags".
Most elements start with an opening tag, a word inside angle brackets, like this: <TITLE>, and end with a closing tag, which is the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash after the first angle bracket, like this: </TITLE>. Some elements have only a single tag instead of an opening and closing tag. In this document you can see examples of elements that have a single tag, such as !DOCTYPE, BR, and HR, and you can see examples of elements that have opening and closing tags, such as HTML, HEAD, TITLE, BODY, H1, H2, H3, and P. Elements with a single tag are sometimes called "empty elements" because they don't contain anything else, whereas most elements contain text between the start and end tags, and those tags indicate something about how the intervening text should be formatted or used. -->

<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is the Title in the Title Bar</TITLE>
</HEAD>


<body class="d-flex flex-column h-100">

<H1>This is the primary Heading text in the document itself</H1>
<H2>You can have a secondary-level Heading, too</H2>
<H3>Or even a tertiary-level Heading, and so on</H3>

<P>Each paragraph of text is usually in its own Paragraph element.</P>
<P>So you'll usually have severals Paragraphs. You can give individual words or phrases added <EM>emphasis</EM>, which usually means <I>italicization</I>, or you can make them more <B>bold</B>.</P>
<P>You might want a line break within a Paragraph, without starting a whole new paragraph, like right here...<BR>
and you might want a horizontal line between objects in the document, like here:</P>

<HR>

<H2>You may use multiple instances of any particular level of Heading</H2>
<P>It's traditional practice to put some contact info for the author somewhere, so readers can give feedback.<BR>
