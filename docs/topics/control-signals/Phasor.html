Phasor
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
In the context of computer music, a <i>phasor</i> means a signal that goes in a linear ramp from 0 to 1 repeatedly at a given frequency, completing a certain number of ramps per second. It can be used to read over-and-over through a lookup table (an array) containing some stored shape, generating a cyclical repeating pattern. That array might contain samples of an actual recorded sound&mdash;a sound clip&mdash;and the phasor would be used to read through it, thus playing a repeating loop. Or the array might contain the shape of a single cycle of a sound wave, and the phasor would read through it at an audible rate to create a cyclical tone.
</p>

<p>
Before giving examples of its usage, let's spend a minute understanding how to make such a ramp from 0 to 1, given a particular sample rate and a given frequency. The first output sample will be 0, and for each subsequent sample we will increment the value by the frequency <i>f</i> over the sample rate <i>R</i>. And if the result equals or exceeds 1, we throw away the integer part and keep the fractional part, thus ensuring that the phasor value always stays between 0 and (just less than) 1.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the sample rate is 44,100 Hz, and the frequency of the phasor is 1 Hz, each output sample would increase by 1/44100 (0.00002267574), so that after 44,100 such increments we will have completed the ramp from 0 to 1 (which will then wrap around to 0). If the frequency of the phasor were 440 Hz, we would increment by 440/44100 (0.00997732426), which would result in completing exactly 440 ramps from 0 to 1 per second.

</p>

<p>
Here's some example code to demonstrate this phasor algorithm.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
var samplerate = 44100.; // samples per second
var frequency = 1.; // ramps per second, from 0 to 1
var increment = frequency / samplerate; // how much to increase the phase
var phase = 0.; // the current value of the phasor

function phasor( arrayofsamples ) { // array passed in a callback
	for ( let n = 0; n < arrayofsamples.length; n++ ) {
	// for as many samples as we need to provide
		arrayofsamples[n] = phase;
		phase += increment; // calculate the next phase value
		if ( phase >= 1. || phase < 0.) {
			phase -= Math.floor( phase ); // keep it between 0 and 1
		}
	}
	return;
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In Max (and Pd) there's an object called <b>phasor~</b> that performs this function. In <b>gen~</b> there is an object called <b>phasor</b> that does the same.
