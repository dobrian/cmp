c-like programming, basic acoustic terms and math, sampling, trig

oscillators

        • general concept of oscillator, circle, phase, wheel
        • phasor
        • simple wave shaping with algebra and logic operators (ramp, square, tri) (adv taylor series)
        • table lookup (sine), by phase truncation
        • aliasing with this method
        • interpolation linear and hermite (adv: article on interpolation methods)
        • other methods - complex sine
        • additive methods for table generation
        • sine wave additive
