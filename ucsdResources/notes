c-like programming, basic acoustic terms and math, sampling, trig

oscillators

        • general concept of oscillator, circle, phase, wheel
        • phasor
        • simple wave shaping with algebra and logic operators (ramp, square, tri) (adv taylor series)
        • table lookup (sine), by phase truncation
        • aliasing with this method
        • interpolation linear and hermite (adv: article on interpolation methods)
        • other methods - complex sine
        • additive methods for table generation
        • sine wave additive

amplitude/envelopes/lines/units/applications/tremolo/compressor/ADSR
  - kick drum gating sine wave
  - auto gain control (always loud)
  - compressor: peak (attack/release), rms, mean
    - compressors with polynomial equations (draw and use a function finder)
  - break point envelopes (time and amplitude)
  - applications in general

filters (allpass [first and second order], FIR, touch on biquad) Allpass with delay.
