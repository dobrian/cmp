# Oscillators

The most basic sound-generating process in digital sound is the oscillator. An oscillator creates a periodic waveform of some shape (sine, square, saw, triangle, etc) and repeats it in time. The number of times it repeats per second (Hz) is its fundamental frequency.

## As a concept

### Unit Circle
A helpful analogy of the (sine) oscillator is that of the wheel and spoke.

The angle of the "spoke" is the phase at a given moment in time while the frequency is the change in phase per unit of time. The length (magnitude) of the spoke is the amplitude at any given point.

### Phase
The phase of a waveform, often denoted with the Greek letter phi (Î¦), is a means to define a specifc point on a waveform. In the analogy above, the unit circle contains 2pi radians around the circumference and thus, one rotation contains 2pi radians of phase.

### Sampled Signals

In our case, we will be working primarily with discrete time; i.e. samples.
